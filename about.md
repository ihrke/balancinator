<h4>About</h4>	


The Balancinator operationalizes gender balance as numeric binary between men and women. When interpreting the plots we encourage you to acknowledge that there might be non-binary gender in your organization and that representation of men and women is only one of many indicators for gender equality. 

The Balancinator was developed within the [Prestige Project](https://uit.no/research/prestige) (2018-2021/281862) at UiT The Arctic University of Norway, a research and intervention project with the goal to promote gender balance in research leadership. It builds on [Duarte et al. (2020), Gender Distribution beyond Coarse Measurements, Report 01/2020, doi:10.7557/7.5687](https://doi.org/10.7557/7.5687)

The source code of the Balancinator is located at: https://github.com/ihrke/balancinator/. The Balance Plot is based on the `divergingPips` R-package developed by Richard Morey: https://github.com/richarddmorey/divergingPips.
