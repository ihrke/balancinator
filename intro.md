The Balancinator is a free and open source software originally created in 2020 by Lilli & Matthias Mittner. It allows anyone to build generic plots to visualize distribution of men and women by inserting simple excel sheets instead of writing programming code. 

The Balancinator operationalizes gender balance as binary between men and women. When interpreting the plots we encourage to acknowledge that there might be more than two genders in your organization and that representation of men and women is only one of many indicators for gender equality. 

The Balancinator was developed within the [Prestige Project](https://uit.no/research/prestige) (2018-2021/281862) at UiT The Arctic University of Norway, a research and intervention project with the goal to promote gender balance in research leadership. It builds on Duarte et al. (2020), Gender Distribution beyond Coarse Measurements, Report 01/2020, [doi:10.7557/7.5687](https://doi.org/10.7557/7.5687)

The Balancinator allows you to:

- Create beautiful evidence to assess gender balance beyond coarse measurements
- Visualize gender balance by means of generic plots of by diverging pips
- Built scatter plots that indicates increase or decrease of gender balance between two points in time
- Measure gender balance in your organization within and across the different units
- Identify units that are in need of specific attention for gender equality measures
- Download image files in .png  (and soon .pdf) format you can use on your presentation, poster, role-up etc.
- Monitor gender balance within and across the different fields of knowledge and disciplines constituting the broad educational and research portfolio of the institution
- Evaluate the effects of interventions at the unitsâ€™ level
- Serve as guidance for the generation of effective and more gender-aware management practices at the institution.

The Balancinator is still under construction. If you have any questions or feedback for improvement please contact lilli.mittner@uit.no
