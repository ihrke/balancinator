The Balancinator is a free and open source software originally created in 2020 by Lilli & Matthias Mittner. It allows anyone to build generic plots to visualize distribution of men and women by inserting simple excel sheets instead of writing programming code. 

The Balancinator operationalizes gender balance as binary between men and women. When interpreting the plots we encourage to acknowledge that there might be more than two genders in your organization and that representation of men and women is only one of many indicators for gender equality. 

The Balancinator was developed within the [Prestige Project](https://uit.no/research/prestige) (2018-2021/281862) at UiT The Arctic University of Norway, a research and intervention project with the goal to promote gender balance in research leadership. It builds on Duarte et al. (2020), Gender Distribution beyond Coarse Measurements, Report 01/2020, [doi:10.7557/7.5687](https://doi.org/10.7557/7.5687)

The Balancinator is still under construction. If you have any questions or feedback for improvement please contact lilli.mittner@uit.no
