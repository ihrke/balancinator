The Balancinator is a free and open source software originally created in 2020 by Lilli & Matthias Mittner. It allows anyone to build colored plots to visualize distribution of men and women by inserting simple excel sheets instead of writing programming code. 

The Balancinator operationalizes gender balance as binary between men and women. When interpreting the plots we encourage to acknowledge that there are more than two genders in your organization and that representation of men and women is only one of many aspects that indicates gender equality. 

The Balancinator was developed within the [Prestige Project](https://uit.no/research/prestige) (2018-2021) at UiT The Arctic University of Norway, a research and intervention project with the goal to promote gender balance in research leadership. It builds on the report "Gender distribution beyond coarse measurements. Balancing gender distribution in professorship positions at the UiT from 2020 and forward" (Duarte et al. 2020).
