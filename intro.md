The Balancinator is a free and open-source software to visualize distribution of men and women within a specific unit. It was originally created in 2020 by Lilli & Matthias Mittner. The Balancinator allows anyone to build generic plots by inserting simple excel sheets instead of writing programming code. 

<h4>The Balancinator allows you to:</h4> 

- build generic plots that require **no coding experiences**
- create beautiful evidence to assess gender balance **beyond coarse measurements**
- visualize gender balance by means of **diverging pips**
- generate **scatter plots** that indicate increase or decrease of gender balance
- download **high quality image files** for your report, presentation, poster, role-up etc.
- update your **annual data** easily
- monitor gender balance **within and across different units**
- identify units at your organization that are in **need of specific gender equality measures**
- evaluate the **effects of interventions** at the unitsâ€™ level
- develop effective and more **gender-aware management** practices at your institution

<h4>Balancinator explained in 4 steps</h4>	

1. **Insert** data
    - either manually by selecting number of years and departments and insert number of men and women
    - or upload excel sheet (or csv) by selecting the template (the head of the table should not be changed in style!)
2. **View** your Balance Plot or Prestige Plot by clicking on the blue buttons
3. **Adjust** colour, size and order
4. **Download** images in .png or .pdf format
