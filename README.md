The Balancinator is a free and open-source software originally created in 2020 by Lilli & Matthias Mittner. It allows anyone to build generic plots to visualize distribution of men and women by inserting simple excel sheets instead of writing programming code. 

<h4>The Balancinator allows you to:</h4> 

- build generic plots that require **no coding experiences**
- create beautiful evidence to assess gender balance **beyond coarse measurements**
- visualize gender balance by means of **diverging pips**
- generate **scatter plots** that indicate increase or decrease of gender balance
- download **high quality image files** for your report, presentation, poster, role-up etc.
- update your **annual data** easily
- monitor gender balance **within and across different units**
- identify units at your organization that are in **need of specific gender equality measures**
- evaluate the **effects of interventions** at the unitsâ€™ level
- develop effective and more **gender-aware management** practices at your institution

The Balancinator is still under construction. If you have any questions or feedback for improvement, please contact balancinator@uit.no.
